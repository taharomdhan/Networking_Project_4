# Networking_Project_4


Hi there ! 

This is a networking project in which we used multiple configuration in cisco devices , it's supposed to be a hotel management network topology in which there is 
3 floors (we will explain in details) 

Network Topology 

- 3 routers connected with each others using serial cabling 
- 3 switches connected to each service in the floor 
- 3 access points in each floor 

Tasks done 

- Assigning ip addresses to the 3 router's 
- Configuring Vlan 9 vlan (vlan 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90) 3 per floor 
- Adding inter-vlan configuration in the 3 routers to connect the devices together 
- Configuring the router as a DHCP server to assign dynamicly ip addresses in the 3 routers 
- Configuring a routing protocol (OSPF) to inter-connect the 3 floors together 
- Adding SSH option 
- Adding the WIFI feature using access points 
- Configuring port security 
- Testing connectivity & it worked like a charm ! 


If you don't have packet tracer you can check the image of the networking topology
